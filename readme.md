# Hi! Welcome to Gyromancy's German VCCV reclist!

This resource contains:
- Core reclists to make the base framework of a German VCCV format voicebank
- Extra reclists for broadening the capabilities of existing reclist

# 1. The [B]asics

This resource can be used as follows
1. You want to start making a German voicebank for UTAU?
Great! Start with the listed `Core_xx` reclists
2.  You want to add different extensions to your existing German VCCV voicebank?
Also great! Choose from the different `Extra_xx` lists

The values noted after the reclist name is the length as a number of required recordings, to give an approximation of the time of recording needed

This German VCCV Reclist is based on YumeWei's [German VCCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWRPe9pBvFA)
Please refer to the provided [Pronunciation Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12E62ImRDOXyS6g6BFJHT9pOU2cFmNrch1UEmuTZqeak/edit#gid=0)

# 2. Starting from [S]cratch

*Is this your first time recording German? You already have recorded German, but want to try the VCCV format?*

Please check out the `Core_CVVC` list first. It will get you acquainted with the vowels and consonants contained in the Standard High German singing style. This list is configured with 2mora. 
It is suggested to record with a BGM in OREMO at 120BPM

Next is the `Core_VV` list. It will add vowel transitions to your voicebank. This list is configured with 5mora, which means 5 syllables per line. (Lower mora option lists will be provided at a later point)

Following this, please record the `Core_VCC` list. This will provide the possible diphthong present for /r/ when it follows vowels in certain situations. Whether or not you pronounce it as /a/ or /r/, record whichever feels more natural to you and pay attention to having a distinct vowel part for blending at the start of the transition.

Finally, you will nee to record the `Core_CC` list. This is needed for the consonant clusters and is the bread and butter of this reclist. Please do not be afraid at the size of the list! You can do them at your own pace regardless of BGM or pitch, since you will only be using the consonant parts. Please pronounce them as naturally as possible, since the automatic clustering provided by the phonemizer will use this to generate a natural pronunciation of clusters.
The noted vowels on this list are also replacable! Please use whichever helping vowels makes it easiest for you to record, as long as you can naturally pronounce the consonants

Please note: as of release, the reclist pack does not provide base oto. Please copy the oto files from the release voicebank. [Yura Sashoune_Gyrolith](https://github.com/Gyromancyx/Yura_Gyrolith)

# 3. Building on [E]xpansion

Support for optional recordings will be added at a later date and is not needed for full comprehensibility

# 4. Fine-Tuning the [C]onfig

Once you have recorded all the components you like, you will have to configure your voicebank. You can get a quick start on this by dropping the oto.ini files present in the release voicebank, [Yura Sashoune_Gyrolith](https://github.com/Gyromancyx/Yura_Gyrolith) , into your associated recording folders.
It is recommended to use vlabeler for configuration instead of Classic UTAU and OpenUTAU's built in configurators

# 5.  Starting [U]sage

You have recorded and configured your voicebank? Congratulations! You can now start using it in UTAU
If you are using OpenUTAU, it is recommended to use the built-in phonemizer for French CVVC contributed by Mim and manipulating the input using phoneme hints. Please refer to the example ust provided alongside the [release video]
